# Sheepheads: doppelkopf-app

This is an open source app for a game called "Sheepheads", which serves the purpose of teaching the user how to play a German card game called *Doppelkopf* 

The whole End-To-End is a rust-based learning project for fun:
* Infrasctrucre: [dopplekopf-cdk](https://github.com/Rbatistab/dopplekopf-cdk/tree/main)
* Frontend application: [dopplekopf-app](https://github.com/Rbatistab/doppelkopf-app)
* Backend: [dopplekopf-rs](https://github.com/Rbatistab/doppelkopf-rs)


## Inspiration

Doppelkopf is a complicated German card game that has many rules. As a non-german speaker, it is hard to find a user friend tutorial online, and the ones you find give more questions than answers (for englis-spoken online versions of the game at least). As a user is hard to have fun while trying to go through a tutorial and not understanding what is going on, not being able to remember the rules.

Sheepheads intents to teach the user on a fun and entertaining manner how to play the game and then offers a platform to play it.
