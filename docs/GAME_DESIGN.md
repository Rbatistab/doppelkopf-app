## Overview

In an era of heroes and adventures, the *sheepheads* (*Schafkopf,* German 16th century term for a "fool”) are a community of heroes that were not picked for any adventure. Much like the people that no one wants to pick on a school game on a PE class. So they join on a quest, on a pokemon-like pixel art open world in 2D, to find adventures that are not already taken by a hero.

However they end up in disreputable bars having arguments with locals that can only be solved by winning German card games that they don’t know how to play.

As the *sheepheads* learn to play the card games, they win the arguments and people give them lame adventures that they don't need but will have fun out of watching them like brushing a cat’s teeth or sleeping a baby that secretly had coffee.

This is a gammification of the tutorial of a complicated game.

The game has two goals:

- To teach the user how to play a complicated German card game called [*doppelkopf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelkopf), by learning a new rule on every level.
- To play *doppelkopf* once the user knows how to.

### Game Name:

Sheepheads

### Inspiration

Doppelkopf is a complicated German card game that has many rules. As a non-german speaker, it is hard to find a user friend tutorial online, and the ones you find give more questions than answers (for englis-spoken online versions of the game at least). As a user is hard to have fun while trying to go through a tutorial and not understanding what is going on, not being able to remember the rules.

Sheepheads intents to teach the user on a fun and entertaining manner how to play the game and then offers a platform to play it.

### Game Elements:

Game elements are the basic activities the player will be doing for fun

### Player:

* On tutorial mode, one player
* On multiplayer mode, 4 players

### Story

On the city of Leipzig people claim for heroes because there are many situations that need to be solved by heroes only. However, there are many heroes, so people get picky and chose the best, normally the main heroes and the best backups. Then there are the *sheepheads* (fools) that folks wouldn’t take seriously and don’t want to join the adventures.

### Setting

The game takes place on 16th century Germany. The setting happens on an open 2D pixel art world.

### Characters

The *sheepheads* are 4:

* Jasper: He's an expert at building organs, who is strong as bull, but had a hernia from lifting organs and his right leg goes numb and all of his right side goes in pain constantly and is always grumpy.
* Sabina: She called herself "rietbergMomMaster1582" and knows every mom hack in the world, however people hate ahead of their time influencers. Everbody thinks is akward to parade everything she does, like her children's breakfast, just because internet doesn't exist yet.
* Matthias: 
* Agnieszka: She's fast and agile, but she's too short

## Game Play

Use the game play section to create a descriptive paragraph about how the game is played. You want the use tor imagine
they are actually playing the game. Try not to use generic (i.e., broad, non-descriptive) terms when writing about the game
play. For example, few readers want to hear statements such as, “enemy_1 will have more hit points than
enemy_2.” Instead, it’s better to make statements like, “The Lazarus Fighter has more armour than the Apollo Fighter.”
Game Play Outline
This outline will vary depending on the type of game.
• Opening the game application
• Game options
• Story synopsis
• Modes
• Game elements
• Game levels
• Player’s controls
• Winning
• Losing
• End
• Why is all this fun?

### Key Features

Key features are a list of game elements that are attractive to the player.

This document describes how GameObjects behave, how they’re controlled and their properties. This is often referred to as
the “mechanics” of the game. This documentation is primarily concerned with
the game itself. This part of the document is meant to be modular, meaning you could have
several different Game Design Documents attached to the Concept Document.

### Design Guidelines
This is an important statement about any creative restrictions that need to be considered and includes brief statements
about the general (i.e., overall) goal of the design.
Game Design Definitions
This section established the definition of the game play. Definitions should include how a player wins, loses, transitions
between levels, and the main focus of the gameplay.

### Game Flowchart
The game flowchart provides a visual of how the different game elements and their properties interact. Game flowcharts
should represent Objects, Properties, and Actions present in the game. Each of these items should have a number reference
to where they exist within the game mechanics document.
• Menu
• Synopsis
• Game Play
• Player Control
• Game Over (Winning and Losing

### Player Definition
● Use this section for quick descriptions that define the player
● Use the Player Properties section (below) to define the properties for each player. Player Properties can be
affected by the player’s action or interaction with other game elements. Define the properties and how they affect
the player’s current game.
● Use the Player Rewards section to make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way. Define these
objects by describing what affect they cause and how the player can use the object.

### Player Definitions
A suggested list may include:
• Health
• Weapons
• Actions

### Player Properties
Each property should mention a feedback as a result of the property changing.
Player Rewards (power-ups and pick-ups)
Make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way (e.g., health replenished)
User Interface (UI)
This is where you’ll include a description of the user’s control of the game. Think about which buttons on a device would be
best suited for the game. Consider what the worst layout is, then ask yourself if your UI is it still playable. A visual
representation can be added where you relate the physical controls to the actions in the game. When designing the UI, it may
be valuable to research quality control and user interface (UI) design information.
